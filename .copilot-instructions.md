# Copilot Instructions for CodePush Frontend

## Project Overview
This is a React-based frontend for the CodePush Server. It uses Vite for development and build processes.

## Key Files
- `src/`: Contains React components and assets.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration for Vite.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Follow React best practices.
- Use functional components and hooks.

## Tips for Future Development
- Use environment variables for server configuration.
- Refer to the CodePush Server API documentation for backend integration.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main application code.
  - `pages/`: Page components.
  - `assets/`: Static assets.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions grouped by functionality.

## Guidelines for Utility Functions
- Place utility functions in the `src/utils/` folder.
- Group related utility functions into separate files (e.g., `authUtils.ts`, `apiUtils.ts`).
- Export functions individually to allow selective imports.
- Write unit tests for all utility functions.

## UI Framework
- Use Material-UI (MUI) for building modern and responsive UI components.
- Refer to the [MUI documentation](https://mui.com/) for component usage and customization.
