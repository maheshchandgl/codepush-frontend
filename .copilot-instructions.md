# Copilot Instructions for CodePush Frontend

## Project Overview
This is a React-based frontend for the CodePush Server. It uses Vite for development and build processes.

## Key Files
- `src/`: Contains React components and assets.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration for Vite.
- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.

## Coding Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety.
- Follow React best practices.
- Use functional components and hooks.
- **Do not use default exports.** Always use named exports for consistency and easier refactoring.
- **Each folder must have an `index.ts` file** to export all files in the folder. This ensures cleaner and more maintainable imports across the project.

## Tips for Future Development
- Use environment variables for server configuration.
- Refer to the CodePush Server API documentation for backend integration.

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Contains the main application code.
  - `components/`: Reusable UI components like `GitHubLoginButton`.
  - `pages/`: Page components.
  - `services/`: API-related logic, such as `authService` for authentication.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions grouped by functionality.

## Guidelines for Components
- Place reusable UI components in the `src/components/` folder.
- Ensure components are modular and follow React best practices.

## Guidelines for Services
- Place API-related logic in the `src/services/` folder.
- Use services to centralize API calls and related logic.

## UI Framework
- Use Material-UI (MUI) for building modern and responsive UI components.
- Refer to the [MUI documentation](https://mui.com/) for component usage and customization.
